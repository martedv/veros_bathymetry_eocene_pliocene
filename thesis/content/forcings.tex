\subsection{Simplified Forcings}
The domain chosen is bounded by longitudes $\phi_E=-180^{\circ}$ and $\phi_W=-180^{\circ}$ and latitudes $\theta_N=80^{\circ}$ and $\theta_S=-80^{\circ}$ with periodic boundary conditions in the zonal direction.
Furthermore the model uses restoring boundary conditions first proposed by \cite{haney1971surface}. Restoring the boundary at the surface of the oceanic basin to be a certain value based of a forcing field for Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), and wind stresses ($\tau$).
 The depth profile has 15 layers with grid stretching. There are $90 \times 40$ grid points to make a $4^{\circ} \times 4^{\circ}$ resolution model. The forcings are prescribed as in \cite{Mulder2017Jul} by highly idealized zonally averaged forcings using current day values. The SST and Zonal wind stress are chosen as the analytical model in \cite{bryan1987parameter}. While SSS is chosen as a zonal average of current day values (from ECMWF but not sure how to cite). The meridional wind stress is set to zero. The maximum ocean depth is 5000m. The model also requires initial conditions for salinity and temperature, for this zonally averaged present day values are again used.
