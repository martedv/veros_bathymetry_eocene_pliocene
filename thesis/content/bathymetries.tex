To facilitate the model a set of 14 bathymetries were created in $5$Ma time steps. From 65Ma to present. These were reconstructed from bathymetries gained in \cite{Baatsen2016Aug}. 
These bathymetrys were subsequently scaled to a 4 degree model and changed to address passage openings in the 4 degree case. Due to the low resolution of the model, choices have to be made with respect to the opening of certain passages. One of the choices that was made is that the Arctic sea is closed of in all of the bathymetrys. This is mainly due to the fact that 4 degree models do not have enough resolution to facilitate this.
The main events that shape the oceanic passages can be devided into time periods. These time periods are defined as follows in this paper. This deviates from their definitions in literature but serves only as a means of applying a name to the time steps.

%TODO (Relevant figures from paleoscene showing changes)
In the paleocene a vast Pacific exists almost serving as a single basin. This period is largely characterized by the growth and development of a larger atlantic basin. Serving to decrease the size of the pacific basin.

The Eocene in contrast to the Paleocene is distinguished by The opening of certain passages connecting oceanic basins. These effects are often studied extensively for each individual passage. Choosing the exact timing for opening the passages is done manually by looking at often active research taking into account big uncertainties in the exact timing of the openings. 
The first of such passage changes that occurs is the Indian continent colliding with the Eurasian continent. This has the effect of closing the deep water formations between the Thetys sea and the Pacific ocean.
Next the Tasman passage is opened as a shallow passage slowly growing in size(\cite{Lawver2003Sep}). The Tasman passage opening is believed to have had a large impact on the onset of the ACC. The Total circulation of water around the antartic basin is finalized by the opening of the shallow Drake passage at around 30Ma. 30Ma is specifically chosen to differentiate between the opening of the drake and Tasman passages. Especially since there is still some debate on the exact timing of drake passage opening (\cite{Scher2006Apr}).

%TODO Oligocene changes
The next time period is the Oligocene Which is largely characterized by the deepening of the Tasman and drake passage and further expansion of the atlantic basin.

%TODO Miocene

The Miocene is Characterized by Some more passage closures. Starting with the closure of the Thetys Seaway at 15Ma(\cite{Hamon2013Nov}). The Thetys seaway had been decreasing in size in the previous 20Ma. Also the Indonesian passage is significantly decreasing in size due to the onset  of multiple islands making the passages more narrow. Further more the Tethys ocean is finally closed at 15Ma, Making northern flow over Africa between the Atlantic and Indian oceans impossible from this point onward. Then another major change occurs with the closure of the central American seaway (\cite{Molnar2008Jun}; \cite{Pindell1988Dec}). Stopping the mid latitude throughflow between the Atlantic and Pacific basins.
