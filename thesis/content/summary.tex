\section{Summary}
In this paper we have presented a simplified approach to the modeling of past climate systems using Veros. This paper focused heavily on simplified forcings of the global oceanic basins. This allows us  to efficiently look at the effect of changes in geometry on the major oceanic flows. The results shown here are of relatively low resolution and highly idealized boundary conditions. But they still manage to capture some of the features of more complex coupled models for the same time period. The integrations were done on a consumer computer showing that it is now possible to do big ocean simulation research on readily available hardware.

We find a large
