\section{Summary}
In this paper we have presented a simplified approach to the modeling of past climate systems using Veros. This paper focused heavily on simplified forcings of the global oceanic basins. This allows in contrast to past attempts using continuation approaches to be able to efficiently look at the effect of changes in geometry on the major oceanic flows. The results shown here are of relatively low resolution and highly idealized boundary conditions. But they still manage to capture many of the effects seen in more complex coupled models. The integrations were done on a consumer computer showing that it is now possible to do big ocean simulation research on readily availible hardware.

The analysis of the results focused specifically on the multiple passage changes that occured in the time period. Specifically noting the effects on the thermohaline circulation.
